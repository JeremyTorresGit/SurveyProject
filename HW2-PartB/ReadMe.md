HW2 Part B uses serialization to save surveys and user responses. 
Survey and response serializable files are located in this directory.
For testing, I created two survey serializable files:
The first includes single answer questions for all types. The second includes multiple answer questions for all types.
The two response serializable files are my responses to each, full survey.
